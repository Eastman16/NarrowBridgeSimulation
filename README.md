## Features
- **Graphical Representation:** Simulates buses moving through various stages of their route, including boarding, going to the bridge, waiting before entering, riding on the bridge, going to the parking, and unloading passengers.
- **Interactive Controls:** Allows users to control the traffic intensity and choose different variants of the simulation:
  - Variant 1: Unrestricted traffic (vehicles are not stopped before entering the bridge)
  - Variant 2: Two-way traffic, limited number of buses on the bridge (up to 3 only)
  - Variant 3: One-way traffic, no limit on the number of buses
  - Variant 4: Only one bus always crosses the bridge at a time.
  - Traffic Intensity: Use the slider to adjust the traffic intensity, controlling the frequency at which buses are spawned in the simulation.
